# Reflections – 1st Quarter Portfolio

## 1. Topics I Know Very Well (I guess...)
1. **HTML Tags**  
   I understand the basic structure of an HTML document and the use of common tags like `<p>`, `<h1>–<h6>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, and `<table>`. These tags help organize and display content in a clear and structured way. I feel confident in combining them to create a webpage that includes formatted text, images, and links. I also know how to use attributes to make my HTML pages more useful and interactive.  

2. **JavaScript Variables and Data Types**  
   I know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`, and I understand the difference in their scope and usage. I can assign values of different data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, and even arrays or objects. Using variables correctly makes it easier for me to store and reuse information in my programs. I am comfortable writing small scripts that rely on variables to calculate and display outputs.  

3. **JavaScript Operators and Expressions**  
   I am ok in using arithmetic, relational, and logical operators in JavaScript. These operators allow me to evaluate expressions and make programs that can compare values or solve calculations. I can write programs that take user input, process it, and give meaningful results using these operators. This has helped me see how math and logic connect to programming.  

4. **Logical Operators in Complex Conditions**  
   I understand simple AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) conditions, and I feel decent applying them in my programs. Testing conditions step by step has helped me avoid mistakes. I now feel comfortable using logical operators to build more reliable decision-making in my code.  

5. **Loop Control Structures (while, do…while, for, for…in)**  
   I understand how loops help programs repeat tasks efficiently. I can use while and do…while loops for conditions, and I know when a for loop is better for counting. The for…in loop is also useful when working with objects or arrays. With loops, I can write shorter and more powerful programs that don’t need repeating code.

## 2. Topics I Know but Need More Practice
1. **Nested Loops**  
   I understand the idea of loops inside other loops, but I sometimes get really confused with the order of execution. Especially when both loops use similar variables or when the output is large. I want to practice more by solving examples like multiplication tables and pattern printing.  

2. **Loop Control (break and continue)**  
   I know that `break` stops a loop and `continue` skips to the next iteration, but I sometimes misuse them. When I write code with these statements, I sometimes end up with unexpected results or skipped logic. More practice will help me use them in the right situations.  

3. **JavaScript Switch Statement and Selection Structures**  
   I know how to use selection structures to make decisions in my programs. For example, I can write a program that checks a student’s grade and outputs if they passed or failed. I also know how to use switch statements for multiple cases, although I am stronger with if-else. I still need more practice to be fully confident, especially with switch cases and avoiding syntax mistakes.  

4. **Combining HTML and JavaScript**  
   I know the basics of linking HTML with JavaScript, but I get stuck when using DOM methods like `getElementById`. Sometimes I forget how to connect a button to a function or how to make interactive features. More practice with small projects will help me get better.  

5. **Complex Selection with Logical Operators**  
   While I’m confident with simple logical operators, I sometimes still struggle when they are mixed with selection structures in long decision trees. It’s easy to get lost with many nested if-else statements. I want to practice breaking them down into smaller parts to avoid confusion.

## 3. Plan of Action
1. **Nested Loops** – I will practice small programs such as multiplication tables or star patterns until I fully understand how nested loops run.  
2. **Loop Control (break and continue)** – I will make sample codes that use both statements and test them to see how the loop flow changes.  
3. **Selection Structures** – I will practice by making small programs with both if-else and switch statements to get used to the differences.  
4. **Combining HTML and JavaScript** – I will build simple interactive webpages, like a button that changes text or images, to get used to DOM methods.  
5. **Complex Selection with Logical Operators** – I will test long conditions step by step and simplify them into smaller expressions.

## 4. Activities: Effective and Not Effective
### Effective
1. **Hands-on Coding Exercises** – Writing actual HTML and JavaScript in class was very effective because I learned by doing. It allowed me to test my ideas immediately and see what worked or failed. Debugging also helped me understand my mistakes better.  
2. **Dashboard/My Courses Practice** – The activities in the online dashboard gave me structured practice problems. These helped me review lessons and apply them on my own, which made me more confident.  

### Not Effective
1. **Long Lectures Without Demo** – Lectures without code examples were less effective for me. I found it harder to understand concepts if I didn’t see them working in a real program. I think I'm just slow in undertanding in general so it's hard especially since I don't want to ask sometimes because my question may seem like common sense.
2. **Copying Code Without Explanation** – When we were just told to copy code without much discussion, it didn’t help me learn. I understood more when the reasoning was explained instead of only following.
